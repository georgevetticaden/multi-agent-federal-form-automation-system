  "description": "User data required to execute the Federal Student Aid Loan Simulator for borrowing more money for college. IMPORTANT: current_loans are the NEW loans you want to simulate borrowing, not existing loans. These represent the loan mix you want to borrow to cover the borrow_amount. For dependent undergrads, use a mix of Direct Subsidized, Direct Unsubsidized (up to annual limits), and Parent PLUS loans to cover remaining gap. For independent/graduate students, use Direct Graduate Unsubsidized and Grad PLUS loans. Look up current federal interest rates and annual borrowing limits to determine appropriate values.",
