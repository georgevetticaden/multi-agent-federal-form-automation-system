  "description": "User data required to execute the Federal Student Aid Loan Simulator for borrowing more money for college. IMPORTANT: current_loans are the NEW loans you want to simulate borrowing, not existing loans. These represent the loan mix you want to borrow to cover the borrow_amount. For dependent undergrads, use a mix of Direct Subsidized, Direct Unsubsidized (up to annual limits), and Parent PLUS loans to cover remaining gap. For independent/graduate students, use Direct Graduate Unsubsidized and Grad PLUS loans. Look up current federal interest rates and annual borrowing limits to determine appropriate values.",
  "$comment": "LOAN STRATEGY CONSTRUCTION GUIDE: When a user asks 'what loans should I take' or 'help me figure out the loan situation', YOU must construct the optimal current_loans array automatically. DO NOT ask the user to specify loan types - you are the expert. FEDERAL LOAN LIMITS FOR DEPENDENT UNDERGRADS: Freshman=$5,500 ($3,500 subsidized + $2,000 unsubsidized), Sophomore=$6,500 ($4,500+$2,000), Junior/Senior=$7,500 ($5,500+$2,000). CRITICAL: Direct PLUS Loan for Parents has NO LIMIT - use it to fill any gap beyond direct student loan limits. CURRENT RATES (2024-25): Direct Subsidized=5.50%, Direct Unsubsidized (undergrad)=6.53%, Direct PLUS (parent/grad)=9.08%. STRATEGY: Always max out cheaper student loans first, then use Parent PLUS for remainder. Example for $40K freshman need: [{type:Direct Subsidized,rate:5.5,balance:3500}, {type:Direct Unsubsidized,rate:6.53,balance:2000}, {type:Direct PLUS Loan for Parents,rate:9.08,balance:34500}]. The sum of all loan_balance values MUST equal borrow_amount.",
