## **MOMENT 1: Campus Tour Discovery** 🎓

**Context:** You're role-playing as your daughter. You're sitting in the car after a Northwestern campus tour with parents. Parents are in front seats talking. You're in back seat on your phone.

**Voice Setup:**
```
[Hold Galaxy Fold 7, tap Claude app]
[Tap voice button, hold phone naturally]
```

**DEMO SCRIPT:**

**YOU (speaking naturally, providing rich context upfront):**
> "Hey Claude, I just finished touring Northwestern and I need to figure out if we can afford it. Can you calculate my federal student aid? I'm 17, born in May 2007, single, from Illinois, and I'll be a freshman in fall 2026. My parents are married, also in Illinois, and our family is four people - me, my parents, and my little brother. Family income last year was $120,000, we have about $30,000 in savings, no child support, and I didn't have any income. Northwestern costs like $85,000 a year."

**CLAUDE (processing rich context):**
```
[Internal: Claude extracts structured data from natural language]
- Birth: May 2007 ✓
- Marital status: Single ✓
- State: Illinois ✓
- Grade level: Freshman ✓
- Parents married: Yes ✓
- Family size: 4 ✓
- Income: $120,000 ✓
- Assets: $30,000 ✓
- Child support: $0 ✓
- Student income: $0 ✓
[Missing: Exact birth date (day)]

[Claude calls: federalrunner_get_wizard_info("fsa-student-aid-estimator.json")]
[Sees it needs: birth month, day, year - has month/year, missing day]
```

**CLAUDE (ONE clarifying question):**
> "Perfect, I have almost everything! What day in May were you born?"

**YOU:**
> "May 15th."

**CLAUDE:**
> "Got it! Let me run the official Federal Student Aid Estimator for you..."

```
[Internal: Claude calls federalrunner_execute_wizard() with complete data]
[Execution: 8-12 seconds - Playwright runs through all 7 pages atomically]
[Returns: SAI + Screenshots]
```

**CLAUDE (15 seconds later):**
> "Your official Student Aid Index is **$18,456**. 
>
> At Northwestern with $85,000 total cost, your expected family contribution is $18,456, leaving about $66,544 to cover through aid, grants, and loans. You are eligible for federal student aid.
>
> Would you like me to compare this with other schools?"

**YOU (impressed):**
> "Wow, that was fast! Yeah, can you do University of Illinois? That's like $32,000 a year."

**CLAUDE:**
> "Since your SAI stays the same, at U of I's $32,000 cost, you'd need about $13,544 after your expected family contribution of $18,456. Much more affordable - and you're still eligible for federal aid!"

---

### **Why This Moment Works:**

✅ **Fast-paced** - One rich query, one clarifying question, done! (~45 seconds)
✅ **Shows natural language processing** - Claude extracts 10+ data points from conversational speech
✅ **Shows intelligence** - Claude knows what's missing, asks only that
✅ **Shows actual FSA execution** - Real federalrunner_execute_wizard() in 8-12 seconds
✅ **Shows immediate comparison** - Instant recalculation for second school
✅ **Emotional beat** - Relief when seeing U of I is more affordable
✅ **Demo-friendly** - Keeps audience engaged, no tedious Q&A

**Timing:** ~1 minute total (down from 3-4 minutes!)

## **MOMENT 2: The "What-If" Scenario** 💰

**Context:** Later that evening, at dinner table. Mom mentions potentially taking a new job.

**Voice Setup:**
```
[At dinner table, pick up phone casually]
[Tap Claude, tap voice]
```

**DEMO SCRIPT:**

**YOU (providing context upfront):**
> "Hey Claude, quick question about my financial aid. My mom might get a new job making more money. Can you recalculate my Student Aid Index if our family income goes from $120,000 to $145,000? Everything else stays the same - same family size, same savings, same state."

**CLAUDE (ZERO clarifying questions needed - has context from before):**
> "Let me recalculate with the higher income..."

```
[Internal: Claude calls federalrunner_execute_wizard() with updated income]
[Fast execution: 8 seconds]
```

**CLAUDE (8 seconds later):**
> "With income at $145,000 instead of $120,000, your Student Aid Index would be **$24,789** - that's about $6,300 higher.
>
> Here's what that means: The extra $25,000 in income would reduce your aid eligibility by roughly $6,300 per year. Net benefit to your family: about $18,700 per year.
>
> Bottom line: Your mom should take the job - you'll still come out ahead even with less aid."

**YOU (to parents, phone down):**
> "See Mom? Claude says you should take it!"

---

### **Why This Moment Works:**

✅ **Ultra-fast** - 30 seconds total, zero back-and-forth
✅ **Shows memory** - Claude remembers previous data
✅ **Shows rapid recalculation** - 8 seconds for new result
✅ **Shows analysis** - Claude does the math comparison automatically
✅ **Shows practical value** - Actionable family decision
✅ **Natural setting** - Real dinner table moment

**Timing:** ~30 seconds (down from 1-2 minutes!)

## **MOMENT 3: Validating the Aid Offer** 🎉

**Context:** Two months later. You just got your acceptance letter from DePaul University with financial aid package. You're excited but confused.

**Voice Setup:**
```
[Sitting on bed, holding acceptance letter]
[Pick up phone, excited energy]
```

**DEMO SCRIPT:**

**YOU (excited, providing full context):**
> "Claude! I just got my acceptance letter from DePaul and I need you to check if their financial aid offer is fair! They're offering me $18,000 in grants plus $5,500 in federal loans, and the total cost is $58,000 per year. Is that reasonable based on my family's finances? We make $120,000, family of four, $30,000 in savings."

**CLAUDE (ONE clarifying question):**
> "Congratulations! Just to confirm - is this still the same student aid situation we calculated before, or has anything changed with your family's income or size?"

**YOU:**
> "Yeah, same everything!"

**CLAUDE:**
> "Perfect, let me verify your aid eligibility..."

```
[Internal: Claude calls federalrunner_execute_wizard() to confirm current SAI]
[Execution: 8 seconds]
```

**CLAUDE (10 seconds later):**
> "Your aid package is **fair and reasonable**. Here's the breakdown:
>
> - Your Student Aid Index: **$18,456**
> - DePaul's total cost: **$58,000**
> - Their aid offered: **$23,500** ($18k grants + $5.5k loans)
> - What you'd actually pay: **$34,500** per year
>
> This aligns with your expected family contribution. The $5,500 in federal loans will need to be repaid, so over 4 years that's $22,000 in debt.
>
> If you have other offers with more grant money and less loans, those might be worth comparing. You could also try negotiating with DePaul if you have competing offers."

**YOU:**
> "Okay, so I'm not getting ripped off? This is normal?"

**CLAUDE:**
> "Exactly. This is a standard aid package for your family's financial situation. You're not getting ripped off - this is what the government says you can afford."

---

### **Why This Moment Works:**

✅ **Shows memory/context** - Claude references previous calculations
✅ **Shows validation use case** - Checking aid offers (huge real value)
✅ **Shows advisory role** - Strategic advice about negotiation
✅ **Emotional support** - Reduces anxiety about finances
✅ **Authentic voice** - "Am I getting ripped off?" is how teens talk
✅ **Fast-paced** - One question, quick confirmation, done

**Timing:** ~45 seconds (down from 2 minutes!)

## **BONUS MOMENT: The Voice Correction** 🎤
*(Include this to show natural voice interaction)*

**Context:** During initial data collection

**YOU:**
> "Our family income is, um... wait, I said that wrong. It's 120,000, not 112,000. One hundred twenty thousand."

**CLAUDE:**
> "No problem, I've updated that to $120,000. Let me continue..."

**Why This Works:** Shows that voice interactions can be corrected naturally, just like human conversation.

## **KEY DEMO PRINCIPLE: Rich Context Upfront**

### **Instead of:**
```
❌ Claude: "What's your income?"
❌ You: "$120,000"
❌ Claude: "How many in family?"
❌ You: "Four"
❌ Claude: "Any savings?"
❌ You: "$30,000"
[12 tedious exchanges...]
```

### **Do this:**
```
✅ You: "I'm 17, born May 2007, single, from Illinois, starting 
        college as a freshman in 2026. My parents are married, 
        we're four people, family income $120k, $30k in savings, 
        no child support, I had no income. Northwestern costs $85k."

✅ Claude: "What day in May were you born?"
✅ You: "15th"
✅ Claude: [8 seconds] "Your SAI is $18,456. At Northwestern..."
```

**Difference:** 1 minute vs. 4 minutes. Audience stays engaged!

## **THE MONEY QUOTE FOR YOUR DEMO**

End with this:

> "Think about what just happened. A 17-year-old girl, lying in bed at 11 PM, worried about college costs, picks up her phone and has a natural conversation that gives her official government financial aid calculations in under a minute. No forms. No confusion. No anxiety. Just answers.
>
> That's the promise of AI + government services. And we just made it real."
