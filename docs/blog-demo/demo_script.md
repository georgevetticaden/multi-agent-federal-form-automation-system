## Introduction (10 seconds)

> "Let me show you something cool. I just created an AI agent that automates federal government forms. I'll play the role of my 17-year-old daughter who's touring colleges."

## First Query - FSA Estimator

**[Voice Query #1 - Short and Natural]:**
> "Hey, can you help me figure out if I can afford Northwestern? I just toured it and it costs like $85K a year."

**[Agent asks for information]**

**[Voice Response - Give key details]:**
> "I'm 17, born May 15th, 2007. I'm from Illinois and I'll be a freshman in fall 2026. My parents are married, we're a family of five. Their income was $200K last year and we have about $100K in savings."

**[Agent asks about dependents/special circumstances]**

**[Voice Response]:**
> "No dependents, and none of those apply to me."

**[Agent shows data confirmation]**

**[Voice Confirmation]:**
> "Yep, looks good."

**[While agent is executing - narrate]:**
> "The agent is automating the 7-page federal form. This normally takes 10-15 minutes..."

[Wait ~48 seconds]

**[When results appear]:**
> "Perfect! Student Aid Index is $43,000. Federal aid is about $7,500 a year. That leaves a gap of about $77,000 per year that we need to figure out."

## Second Query - Loan Simulator

**[Voice Query #2 - Natural Follow-up]:**
> "My parents said they'll cover 75%. What loans should I take for the rest? I'm thinking business major, probably making like 65K after."

**[While agent is executing - narrate]:**
> "Watch - it's using a different government calculator and figuring out the optimal loan mix automatically..."

[Wait ~47 seconds]

**[When results appear]:**
> "Cool - it came up with a 3-loan strategy: $3,500 subsidized, $2,000 unsubsidized, and the rest in a Parent PLUS loan. About $300 a month after I graduate."

**[Show Screenshot 1 - Page 6 with 3 loans]:**
> "This is the smart part - the agent read a schema that has all the federal loan rules and rates built in. It figured out the optimal mix automatically. No hardcoded logic."

**[Show Screenshot 2 - Results page]:**
> "And here's the official calculator results."

## Wrap-Up (20 seconds)

> "So in about 2 minutes, she got answers from two different federal calculators. No forms, no confusion. Just asked questions on her phone and got official government results.
>
> That's what AI-powered government services should look like."
