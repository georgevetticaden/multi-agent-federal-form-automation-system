# Scripts (deployment scripts not needed in Cloud Build)
scripts/

# IMPORTANT: Do NOT ignore wizards/ directory
# The deployment script copies wizards before upload, and we need them in the container
# !wizards/  ← This syntax doesn't work reliably in gcloudignore

# Keep these files/directories:
# - src/ (application code)
# - wizards/ (MUST be included - copied by deployment script)
# - requirements.txt (Python dependencies)
# - Dockerfile (used by Cloud Build)
